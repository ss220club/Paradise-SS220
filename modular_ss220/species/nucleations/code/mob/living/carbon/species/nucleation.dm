	supermatter crystal clusters have begun to grow across their bodies. Research to find a cure for this ailment \
	has been slow, and so this is a common fate for veteran engineers. The supermatter crystals produce oxygen, \
	negating the need for the individual to breathe. Their massive change in biology, however, renders most medicines \
	obselete. Ionizing radiation seems to cause resonance in some of their crystals, which seems to encourage regeneration \
	and produces a calming effect on the individual. Nucleations are highly stigmatized, and are treated much in the same \
	way as lepers were back on Earth."
